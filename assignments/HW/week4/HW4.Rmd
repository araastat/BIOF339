## Reading

1. [Section 5.6.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs) of *R for Data Science* gives examples of various summary functions in R. They are using a dataset in those examples derived from the `flights` dataset, which you can create using the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
library(nycflights13) # Install this package if you don't have it

not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time))
```


## Homework

The dataset [here](data/clinical_data_breast_cancer_hw.csv) provides clinical and
pathological data for 105 breast cancer patients. Create a fresh RMarkdown file and answer the following questions:

1. Read this data into R, calling it `brca_data`. 
1. This data is in tidy format, but needs cleaning. 
    a. Evaluate whether all the variables are of the correct type. If not, evaluate why, and correct the problem.
    b. For the molecular results for ER, PR and HER2, any entry that is not Positive or Negative should be changed to a missing value.
1. Create a new dataset that contains patient ID, ER, PR and HER2 status. You need to use one of the functions `starts_with`, `ends_with` or `contains` within the `select` function. 
1. Creating new variables (what `dplyr` function will you use for all of these?):
    a. Create a variable giving the TNM status of each patient. The T, N and M statuses are given separately. I want a single variable encoded as, for example, "T2N0M0". [Hint: The function `paste` is your friend]
    c. Create a variable that divides the patients into 3 categories based on molecular profiles [Hint: The function `case_when` might help]:
        - Luminal (ER positive and/or PR positive)
        - HER2 (HER2 positive)
        - Basal-like (ER, PR and HER2 negative)
    d. Create a variable that equals the time of death if they are dead (see the variable `Vital.Status`) or the time of last contact if they are alive. This is a common computation for survival analysis studies, and is called the overall survival time. [Hint: the function `ifelse` might be useful]
1. Let's compute some summaries 
    a. Find the number of patients with each breast cancer type
    a. Find the average age of patients with each breast cancer type
    a. Find the proportion of patients who are dead for each breast cancer type
    a. Find the proportion of patients with each TNM status

> c and d require creating a new variable to compute the proportion after determining the counts using either `count` or a group_by/summarize pipe using `n()`.

**[Extra credit:]** What proportion of the Luminal patients are of tumor stage T1 or T2?

Save the cleaned breast cancer dataset as `brca_cleaned`. You can save this to your computer using `saveRDS(brca_cleaned, file="<a filename of your choice>.rds")`. We'll be using this dataset again whe we do plots and modeling.

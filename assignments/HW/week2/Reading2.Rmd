# Readings

1. Learn about **tidy data* by reading [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) from the `tidyr` documentation, or the [actual paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)
1. [Section 5.6.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs) of *R for Data Science* gives examples of various summary functions in R. They are using a dataset in those examples derived from the `flights` dataset, which you can create using the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
library(nycflights13) # Install this package if you don't have it

not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time))
```

## What is the tidyverse?

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. -- Dr. Hadley Wickham

- A human-friendly syntax and semantics to make code more understandable
- The functions in the tidyverse often wraps harder-to-understand functions into simpler, more understandable forms
- We're taking an opinionated choice here
    - Covers maybe 85% of the cases you'll ever face
    - Takes a particular viewpoint about how data _should_ be organized
- But this makes things easier and simpler

----
The [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org) site and the [R4DS book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) 
are the definitive sources for tidyverse information.  
The packages are united in a common philosophy of how data analysis should be done.

## Tidy data

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;font-size:30pt;font-family:'Roboto Slab';width:100%;height:300px;background-color:wheat;text-align:center;padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 0px;border: 1px solid red; position: relative;">

Tidy datasets are all alike, <br/>
but every messy data is messy in its own way

</div>

---

## Tidy data

Tidy data is a **computer-friendly** format based on the following characteristics:

- Each row is one observation
- Each column is one variable
- Each set of observational unit forms a table

All other forms of data can be considered **messy data**.

---

## Let us count the ways

There are many ways data can be messy. An incomplete list....

+ Column headers are values, not variables
+ Multiple variables are stored in a single column
+ Variables are stored in both rows and columns
+ Multiple types of observational units are saved in the same table
+ A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

---

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

1. Column headers contain values

Country   |   < $10K    | $10-20K    | $20-50K   | $50-100K    | > $100K
----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------
India     |   40        |  25        |   25      |  9          |  1
USA       |   20        |  20        |  20       | 30          |  10

---

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

Column headers contain values

Country   |   Income  | Percentage
----------|-----------|------------
India     |  < $10K   |  40
USA       |  < $10K   | 20

This is a case of reshaping or melting 

---

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

Multiple variables in one column

Country  | Year   | M_0-14  | F_0-14  | M_ 15-60  | F_15-60  | M_60+  | F_60+
---------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|-------
UK       |  2010  |         |         |           |          |        | 
UK       |  2011  |         |         |           |          |        | 

<p>
Separating columns into different variables

## Tidying data

The typical steps are 

+ Transforming data from wide to tall (`pivot_longer`) and from tall to wide (`pivot_wider`)
+ Separating columns into different columns (`separate`)
+ Putting columns together into new variables (`unite`)

----
>The functions `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` supercede the older functions `gather` and `spread`, 
which I have used in previous iterations of this class. However, if you are familiar with `gather` and `spread`, they aren't gone and can still be used in the current **tidyr** package.

---


## Tidy data

A first step in the tidyverse is to activate the `tidyverse` meta-package

```{r munging-1, message = F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

<font size=5>
.pull-left[
```{r munging-2, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
tidy_pkgs <- 
  tibble('pkgs' = c('ggplot2','purrr','readr','tidyr',
                    'dplyr','forcats','lubridate','stringr')) %>% 
  mutate(
    descr = map_chr(pkgs, ~packageDescription(., fields='Title')))

glue_data(tidy_pkgs[1:4,], 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-3, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
glue_data(tidy_pkgs[5:8,], 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")
```
]
</font>

---

## Tidy data

The common feature of all these packages is that their functions take a 
data frame (which the tidyverse calls a `tibble`) as their first argument.

So the starting point for any analysis is the data set.

---

## Tidy data

```{r munging-4 }
table1
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r munging-5 }
table2
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r munging-6 }
table3
```

Is this tidy?

---


## Tidy data

```{r munging-7 }
table4a # cases
table4b # population
```

Are these tidy?

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

Sometimes. The functions in the `tidyr` package can help

- `separate` is a function that can split a column into multiple columns
    - When there are multiple variables together in a column
    
```{r munging-8 }
table3
```

We need to separate `rate` into two variables, cases and population

---



## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r munging-9 }
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), 
         sep = "/", 
         convert = TRUE) # convert type if possible #<<
```

> I've been explicit about naming all the options. R functions can work by 
position as well, so `separate(table3, rate, c('cases','population'), '/')` would work, but it's not very clear, is it?

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r munging-10 }
table2
```

Here there are observations on two variables in successive rows

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

We need to `spread` these rows out into different columns. This function is now called `pivot_wider`.

.left-column30[
![](../img/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)
]
.right-column70[
```{r munging-11 }
pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```
]

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r munging-12 }
table4a
```

Here, the variable for year is stored as a header, not as data in a cell.

We need to `gather` that data and put it into a column. This function is now called `pivot_longer`

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

.left-column30[
![](../img/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)
]

.right-column70[
```{r munging-13 }
pivot_longer(table4a, names_to = 'year', values_to  = 'cases', 
    cols = c(`1999`, `2000`))
```
]

---

## Making data tidy

Admittedly, `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` are not easy concepts, but we'll practice with them more. 

1. `pivot_longer` collects multiple columns into 2, and only 2 columns
    - One column represents the data in the column headers
    - One column represents the values in the column
    - All other columns are repeated to keep all the data properly associated
1. `pivot_wider` takes two columns and makes them multiple columns
    - The values in one column form the headers to different new columns
    - The values in the other column represent the values in the corresponding cells
    - The other columns are repeated to start with, but reduce repetitions to make all associated data stay together

## Tidying the weather data

```{r munging-15 }
library(tidyverse)
weather_data <- rio::import('../data/weather.csv')

```

.pull-left[
```{r munging-16, echo=F}
head(weather_data)
```
]
.pull-right[

1. Days are in separate columns
1. Temperatures for each day is in two rows, max and min
1. Don't worry about missing values. Just work on getting the shape right
]

---

## Tidying the weather data

```{r munging-17, eval = T, echo = T}
weather1 <- pivot_longer(weather_data, names_to='day', values_to='temp', 
                         cols = c(-(1:4))) #<<
head(weather1,5)
```



---

## Tidying the weather data

```{r munging-19, eval = T, echo = T}
weather1 <- pivot_longer(weather_data, names_to='day', values_to='temp', 
                         cols = c(-(1:4))) 
weather2 <- pivot_wider(weather1, names_from='element', values_from = 'temp')
head(weather2, 5)
```


---

## Tidying the weather data


```{r munging-21, eval = T, echo = T}
weather1 <- pivot_longer(weather_data, names_to='day', values_to='temp', 
                         cols = c(-(1:4))) 
weather2 <- pivot_wider(weather1, names_from='element', values_from = 'temp')
weather3 <- separate(weather2, col='day', into=c('symbol','day'), sep=1)
head(weather3,5)
```

This gets us into the right shape for the data. 

There still is some work to do, but the format is tidy




---

## Data transformation (dplyr)

The `dplyr` package gives us a few verbs for data manipulation

```{r munging-23, echo = F, results='asis'}
dat <- tribble(
  ~Function, ~Purpose,
  'select', "Select columns based on name or position",
  'mutate', 'Create or change a column',
  'filter', 'Extract rows based on some criteria',
  'arrange', 'Re-order rows based on values of variable(s)',
  'group_by', 'Split a dataset by unique values of a variable',
  'summarize', 'Create summary statistics based on columns')
knitr::kable(dat, format='markdown')
```

---

## `select`

You can select columns by name or position, of course, e.g., `select(weather, month)` or `select(weather, 3)`

You can select consecutive columns using `:` notation, e.g. `select(weather, d1:d31)`

You can also select columns based on some criteria, which are encapsulated in functions.

- `starts_with("___")`, `ends_with("___")`, `contains("____")`
- `one_of("____","_____","______")`
- `everything()`

There are others; see `help(starts_with)`.

These selection methods work in all tidyverse functions

> Note that for `select` the names of the columns don't need to be quoted. This is called *non-standard evaluation* and
is a convenience. However for the criteria-based selectors within `select`, you **do** need to quote the criteria

---

## select

.pull-left[
```{r munging-24, eval = F, echo = T}
weather1 <- select(weather_data, year, month, d1:d31) #<<
head(weather1, 20)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-25, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-24"}
```
]

---

## select

.pull-left[
```{r munging-26, eval = F, echo = T}
weather1 <- select(weather_data, starts_with('d')) #<<
head(weather1, 20)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-27, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-26"}
```
]


---

## select

The flexibility of the `select` function, which is also used in other tidyverse functions like `pivot_longer`, and others we'll see presently, is quite powerful. 

Suppose you have a large genomic data where the columns are different genes, and suppose that the housekeeping genes all start with "HK". Then, in order to _remove_ the housekeeping genes, you could just do

```{r munging-54, eval=F}
new_data <- select(old_data, -starts_with("HK"))
```

Here, the `-` sign means, remove those columns.

Also note that we have to assign the selected dataset to a new (or old) name in order to 
preserve it in the workspace.

---

## select

I always prefer naming my columns well and using the capabilities of `select` to grab columns. 

However, you can use `select` with column numbers. For example, if you wanted to grab the 
first 4 columns of a dataset, you could do

```{r munging-55, eval=F}
new_data <- select(old_data, 1:4)
```

.footnote[The notation `1:4` is a short hand for the sequence `1,2,3,4`. Generally, the notation `m:n` means the set of consecutive integers between `m` and `n`.]

---

## mutate

`mutate`, as the name suggests, either creates a new column in your data set or transforms an existing column.

.pull-left[
```{r munging-28, eval = F, echo = T}
weather4 <- mutate(weather3, 
                   num_day = as.numeric(day))
as_tibble(weather4)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-29, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-28"}
```
]

---

## mutate

`mutate` can either transform a column in place or create a new column in a dataset

.pull-left[
```{r munging-30, eval = F, echo = T}
weather4 <- mutate(weather3, day = as.numeric(day))
as_tibble(weather4)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-31, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-30"}
```
]

---

## mutate

`mutate` can also be used to deal with missing values, by replacing them with a value, for example

.pull-left[
```{r munging-32, eval = F, echo = T}
mutate(weather4, tmax = replace_na(tmax, 0))
```

You wouldn't want to do exactly this, of course
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-33, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-32"}
```
]

---

## across

**dplyr** version 1.0 introduced a new verb, `across` to allow functions like `mutate` (and `summarize`, which we shall see in the statistics module) to act on a selection of columns 
which can be chosen using the same syntax as `select`, or by condition.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=F}
mutate(mpg, 
       cty = cty * 1.6/3.8,
       hwy = hwy * 1.6/3.8)
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-59, echo=T, eval=F}
mutate(mpg, 
       across(c(cty, hwy), 
                   function(x) {x * 1.6/3.8}))
```
]

-----



```{r munging-60,eval=F}
mutate(mpg, 
       across(is.character, as.factor)) # select based on condition
```


---

## filter

`filter` extracts **rows** based on criteria

So if we wanted to just grab January data, we could use

.pull-left[
```{r munging-34, eval = F, echo = T}
january <- filter(weather4, month==1)
head(january)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-35, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-34"}
```
]

---

## filter

Some comparison operators for filtering

| Operator | Meaning                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| ==       | Equals                           |
| !=       | Not equals                       |
| > / <    | Greater / less than              |
| >= / <=  | Greater or equal / Less or equal |
| !        | Not                              |
| %in%     | In a set                         |

Combining comparisons

| Operator   | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| &          | And     |
| &#124;       | Or      |

---

## filter

Some comparison operators for filtering

Strings: `str_detect(<variable>, "<string>")` or `str_detect(<variable>, "<regex>")`

Regex or regular expression basics:

```{r, echo=F}
tribble(~Expression, ~Meaning,
        '[a,b,c]', 'Matches "a", "b" or "c"',
        '[a-z]', 'Matches letters between "a" and "z"',
        '[^abc]', 'Matches anything except "a", "b" and "c"',
        "[:alpha:]", "letters",
        "[:digit:]", "digits",
        "[:alnum:]", "letters or numbers",
        "[:punct:]", "punctuation") %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

.footnote[Many more details are available [here](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html#special-characters-1) and a cheatsheet is available [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)]

---

## filter

Let's use the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package

.pull-left[
```{r munging-36, eval = F, echo = T}
mpg1 <- filter(mpg, 
       (year==1999) & 
         (class %in% c('minivan','suv')))
select(mpg1, manufacturer, cty, hwy, class, year)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-37, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-36"}
```
]

---

## filter

A common use of `filter` is to remove rows with missing values from your dataset

.pull-left[
```{r munging-38, eval = F, echo = T}
weather5 <- filter(weather4, 
                   !is.na(tmax) & !is.na(tmin))
head(weather5, 20)
```

`is.na` is a *function* that tests whether a value is missing or not. 

So `!is.na` is the opposite of that. 
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-39, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-38"}
```
]

## Important distinction

.acid[The `filter` function affects **rows** of a dataset]
]
.pull-right[
.heat[The `select` function affects **columns** of a dataset]
]

---

## slice

You can use `slice` and siblings to subset **rows** of a data set by index. 

+ `slice(mpg, 1,2,5)` grabs rows 1, 2 and 5
+ `slice_head(mpg)` / `slice_tail(mpg)` grabs first/last row of data set
    - You can specify an argument `n` for the number of rows to grab
    - You can specify an argument `prop` for the proportion of rows to grab
+ `slice_sample(mpg, 10)` grabs 10 rows at random, without replacement
+ `slice_min(mpg, hwy)` / `slice_max(mpg, hwy)` gives the `n`/`prop` rows with the lowest/highest values of `hwy`.



---

## arrange

`arrange` reorders **rows** of a data set according to the values of one or more variables

.pull-left[
```{r munging-40, eval = F, echo = T}
arrange(weather5, day)
```

Not quite. 
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-41, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-40"}
```
]

---

## arrange

.pull-left[
```{r munging-42, eval = F, echo = T}
arrange(weather5, month, day)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r munging-43, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="munging-42"}
```
]

---

## arrange

1. I use `arrange` sparingly in my workflow
  - For spiffying up final presentation tables
  - If order is **really** important
1. Sorting data is one of the most computationally expensive operations you can do
  - It can crash your computer for big data

---

## Cluttering up our workspace

We've done a bit, but lets see all the objects we've created

```{r munging-44 }
ls()
```

We see a lot of intermediate datasets we've created, that we aren't going to really use anymore

---
class: middle, center

# Workflow pipes in the tidyverse

---

## Intermediate data sets

Recall how we cleaned the weather dataset yesterday

```{r munging-45, eval = F}
weather_data <- rio::import('../data/weather.csv')
weather1 <- pivot_longer(weather_data, names_to='day', values_to = 'temp', cols = starts_with('d'))
weather2 <- pivot_wider(weather1, names_from = element, values_from=temp)
weather3 <- separate(weather2, day, c('symbol','day'), sep = 1, convert=TRUE)
weather4 <- select(weather3, -symbol)
# weather4 <- mutate(weather2, day = readr::parse_number(day))
weather5 <- mutate(weather4,
                   tmax = replace_na(tmax, 0),
                   tmin = replace_na(tmin, 0))
weather6 <- arrange(weather5,year,month,day)
```

This required us to create and keep track of several intermediate datasets

These datasets are essentially temporary datasets which do not hold the final result

What we did is a series of sequential steps to process the data

The `parse_number` function extracts the first number out of a character string. For example, 
`parse_number('abc254')` outputs `r readr::parse_number('abc254')`.

# Pipes

---
  
## Pipes

Pipes are a method in R to create analytic pipelines utilizing tidyverse functions.

The pipe operator (denoted `%>%`, spoken as "then") is what creates the pipes.

You start with a dataset, and then progressively add functions to the pipe. Typically you save the result to a new object.

Each element of the pipe takes as its first argument the results of the previous step, which typically is a data frame.

Pipes are just a different representation of an analytic process that we can do in separate steps anyway. 

.footnote[The keyboard shortcut for the pipe operator in RStudio is .heatinline[`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + m`]]

---

## Pipes

.pull-left[
Without pipes

```{r munging-62}
mpg1 <- mutate(mpg, id = 1:n())
mpg2 <- select(mpg1, id, year, trans, cty, hwy)
mpg_final <- mutate(mpg2, 
                    across(c(cty, hwy), 
                           function(x) {x * 1.6/3.8}))
```

]
.pull-right[
With pipes

```{r munging-63}
mpg_final <- mpg %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>% 
  select(id, year, trans, cty, hwy) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(cty, hwy), 
                function(x){x*1.6/3.8}))
```

]

The important things to note here are:

1. When using pipes, the results of one operation are automatically entered into the **first argument** of the next function, so the actual specification omits the first argument
1. If you need the results of one step to go to some other argument of the next function, you can represent that input by `.`, for example, .fatinline[`mpg %>% lm(cty ~ hwy, data = .)`] takes the dataset `mpg` and places it in the argument for `data` in the `lm` function.

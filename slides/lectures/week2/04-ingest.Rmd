## A quick refresh

+ We talked about various data structures in R
+ The primacy of the `data.frame`
  - Extracting individual variables from a data frame
    - `breast_cancer$ER.Status`, `breast_cancer[,'ER.Status']`, `breast_cancer[['ER.Status']]`
  - Extracting rows of a `data.frame`
+ Identifying data classes using the `class` function
+ Recognizing different classes: `numeric`, `character`, `factor`, `Date`, ..
  - testing for a class: `is.numeric`
  - converting to a class: `as.numeric`

## RMarkdown tip of the day

You can add options to each R chunk to add or suppress output

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-6, echo = FALSE}
a <- tribble(
  ~Option, ~Property,
  "echo=TRUE/FALSE", "Does the document show the R code",
  "eval=TRUE/FALSE", "Does the chunk get evaluated by R",
  "message=TRUE/FALSE", "Do messages get printed",
  "warning=TRUE/FALSE", "Do warnings get printed"
)
knitr::kable(a, format='html')
```

You can also set these globally in a RMD file by putting the following in the first R chunk:

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-7, eval=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F)
```

See [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk-options) for the full gory details

.footnote[Note that the correct way to write `TRUE` and `FALSE` is .heatinline[all caps]. They can be shortened to `T` and `F` respectively, but it's better to get used to the full word.]
---

## Package tip of the semester

Use 
```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
or
```{r, eval=F}
pacman::p_load('tidyverse')
```

for pretty much every R script and R Markdown file (put this at the top of a script file, but after the header in a R Markdown)

# Data ingestion

---

## Data ingestion

Unlike Excel, you have to pull data into R for R to operate on it

Typically your data is in some sort of file (Excel, csv, sas7bdat, dta, txt)

You need to find a way to pull it into R

The GUI you've used is one way, but not very programmatic

---

## Data ingestion

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-8, echo=F}
b <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Function, ~Package,~Notes,
  "csv", "read_csv", "readr", "Takes care of formatting",
  "csv", "read.csv", "base", "Built in",
  "csv", "fread", "data.table", "Fastest",
  "Excel", "read_excel", "readxl",'',
  'sas7bdat','read_sas', 'haven','SAS format',
  'sav', 'read_spss', 'haven','SPSS format',
  'dta','read_dta', 'haven', 'Stata format'
)
knitr::kable(b, format='html')
```

---

# Data ingestion

We will use [this](../data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv) csv data and [this](../data/BreastCancer.xlsx) Excel data for the following:

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-9, message=F}
brca_clinical <- readr::read_csv('../data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
brca_clinical2 <- data.table::fread('../data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
```

.pull-left[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-10}
str(brca_clinical)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-11}
str(brca_clinical2)
```
]

---

## A note on two "super"-data.frame objects

.pull-left[
A `tibble`
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-12, echo=F}
head(brca_clinical)
```
]
.pull-right[
A `data.table`

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-13, echo=F}
head(brca_clinical2)
```
]

---

## A note on two "super"-data.frame objects

+ A `tibble` works pretty much like any `data.frame`, but the printing is a little saner
+ A `data.table` is faster, has more inherent functionality, but has a very different syntax

We'll work almost entirely with `tibble`'s and not `data.table`

--

Suggested modifications:

+ If using `fread`, convert the resulting object to a `data.frame` or `tibble` using `as_data_frame()` or `as_tibble()`
+ Convert the column names to not have spaces using, for example,

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-14}
brca_clinical <- janitor::clean_names(brca_clinical)
```

## Data ingestion

Note that you **have** to give a name to what you're importing using `read_*` or whatever you're using, otherwise it won't stay in R

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-15, eval=F}
brca_clinical <- readr::read_csv('../data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
```

![](../img/env.png)

> See what happens if you don't give a name to a dataset you ingest.

---

## Reading Excel

You can find the names of the sheets in an Excel file:
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-16}
readxl::excel_sheets('../data/BreastCancer.xlsx')
```

So you can ingest a particular sheet from an Excel file using
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-16a}
brca_expression <- readxl::read_excel('../data/BreastCancer.xlsx', sheet='Expression')
```

## Data export

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-17, echo=F}
b <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Function, ~Package,~Notes,
  "csv", "write_csv", "readr", "Takes care of formatting",
  "csv", "write.csv", "base", "Built in",
  "csv", "fwrite", "data.table", "Fastest",
  "Excel", "write.xlsx", "openxlsx",'',
  'sas7bdat','write_sas', 'haven','SAS format',
  'sav', 'write_spss', 'haven','SPSS format',
  'dta','write_dta', 'haven', 'Stata format'
)
knitr::kable(b, format='html')
```

We'll often save tabular results using these functions

.footnote[These can also be useful for exporting results, but the R Markdown related packages are better for that]

## Simplifying import/export

---

We'll be using a package that makes this easier. 

It's called **rio** and it has two basic functions: `import` and `export`.

The `rio` package uses the different packages mentioned earlier but unifies it into a single syntax

For example:

```{r, eval=F}
rio::import('data/clinical_data_breast_cancer_modified.csv')
```

--

**rio** reads the end of the file being imported or exported and decides which functions from which package should be used for the job. 

**rio** accesses different packages that are right for each job, so you don't have to.

---

You can also import multiple sheets from Excel, or multiple objects from .RData files, into a list of data frames

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
dat <- rio::import_list('data/BreastCancer.xlsx')
```
```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
dat <- rio::import_list('../data/BreastCancer.xlsx')
```
```{r}
class(dat)
names(dat)
map_chr(dat, class)
```

## Saving your work

You would often like to store intermediate datasets, and final datasets, so that you can access them quickly.

There are several ways of saving even large datasets so that they can be quickly accessed. 

| Function  | Package | Example                                  | Retrieving the stored data          |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| saveRDS   | base    | `saveRDS(weather, file = 'weather.rds')` | `weather <- readRDS('weather.rds')` |
| write_fst | fst     | `write_fst(weather, file='weather.fst')` | `weather <- read_fst('weather.fst')` |

These methods are meant for storing .fatinline[single objects]

---

## Saving your work

If you want to store all of your objects into a single file, you can store them in a .RData file.

```{r rda, eval=FALSE}
save.image(file="<filename>.RData")
```

To keep multiple specified objects in a .RData file,

```{r rda2, eval=FALSE}
save(<obj1>, <obj2>, <obj3>, file = "<filename>.RData")
```

------

## Retrieving your work

You can retrieve the objects in a .RData file using the function `load`. 

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
load(file = "<filename>.RData")
```

This will store each object in its original name in your R environment.

# Is there a difference in ozone between months

.pull-left[
```{r 01-intro-20, echo=T}
summary(aov(Ozone ~ Month, data=airquality))
```

Whoops!! Only 1 df but 5 months!! 

This is doing ANCOVA/Regression

```{r 01-intro-21, echo=T}
summary(aov(Ozone~factor(Month), data=airquality))
```

`factor` can convert a numerical or character variable into a categorical variable

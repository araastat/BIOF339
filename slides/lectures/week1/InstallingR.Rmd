## Open a new script 

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/NewScript.png')
```
]

.pull-right[
You will start by opening a new script

- This is a blank canvas
- You will write R code (instructions) in this script
- This is just a text editor, so you can copy, paste, edit just as in Notepad
- Good practice is to write code in the script window, then **send** the code to R
]

## Run some code

.pull-left[

Write some code, then send it to the console, where R is running

- You can use the button, but
- I prefer you learn the keyboard shortcut
- Ctrl/Cmd + Enter sends either
  - current line under cursor
  - highlighted code

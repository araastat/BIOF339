## R Markdown

This determines the title and author, and the output type. Typically don't modify the 
entry in `output` for now

````markdown
`r ''````{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
````

This is a code chunk. RMarkdown evaluates this chunk of code and replaces the code 
with the results. This code chunk happens to be named "cars". The naming is optional but useful.

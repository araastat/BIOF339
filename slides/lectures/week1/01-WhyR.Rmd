# Why use a scripting language for analysis?

.pull-left[
.large[Pros:]

1. .heatinline[Have to think]
1. Reproducible (custom) workflows
1. Much less error-prone
1. Much lower costs to repeat analyses, or as you learn more
1. Easily leverage work of smarter developers
1. Easier to work with larger datasets (more than size of screen)
]
.pull-right[
.large[Cons:]

1. Have to type
1. Have to know the language
1. Higher initial startup cost
1. .heatinline[Have to think]

+ If your code is not right, it won't run
  - Can be frustrating

# Why use `r fa('r-project', fill='steelblue')`?

+ Specializes in statistics and data visualization
+ Flexible
  - ~~_If you can do it_~~ __How you can do it__
+ Large ecosystem
  - Over 16,000 packages, 1500+ dedicated to bioinformatics
  - Can read from most sources of data
  - Generic and specialized analyses
+ Fantastic community
  - Twitter, StackOverflow, blogosphere, conferences, online books

---

# Why use `r fa('r-project', fill='steelblue')`?

R is a very high-quality product that is accepted and used widely in 
government agencies, corporations and universities worldwide

- Standard data analytic software in bioinformatics, behavioral health and many aspects of quantitative finance
- Increasingly used in pharma, economics, political science and engineering

--

R is open-source, in that anyone can see the actual code and validate the 
computations directly

---

# Why use `r fa('r-project', fill='steelblue')`?

- R has a well-deserved reputation for being a great data visualization 
tool, with users being able to create complex, customizable graphs with relative 
ease
- As a scripting language, it allows the same workflows to be coded and re-used.
- You can set up workflows to validate data, in terms of data quality and missingness, 
which avoids visual inspection which can be time-consuming and mistake-prone. 
- R can handle large datasets, and can work with multiple datasets at the same time

---

# Why use `r fa('r-project', fill='steelblue')`?

Specialized packages available for many domains

- Bioinformatics
- Econometrics
- Maps and spatial analytics 
- Text mining and Natural Language Processing

The [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) 
provide curated lists of packages based on different domains

The [Bioconductor Project](https://www.bioconductor.org) is THE source for bioinformatics packages in R. It is the gold standard for many bioinformatic workflows



---

# Things `r fa('r-project', fill='steelblue')` is not (in this class)

--

- The 18th letter of the English alphabet

--

- A magic incantation that will produce an analysis

--

- Just something the cool kids are doing

--

- Point-and-click, automatic, WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)
    - So it's not Excel, SPSS, Prism, GraphPad
    - It's much more!!!

---

# A note on Excel `r fa('file-excel', fill='steelblue')`

.pull-left[
   

Excel is omnipresent, so it becomes the default data medium

It is great for many things, including _quick-and-dirty_ analyses

.heatinline[It can be error-prone]

It needs to be backed up

It has size limitations

Takes a lot of effort to do complex analyses

--

.pull-right[
+ No way to reproduce analyses without macros
+ No way to document what you are doing
+ Excel has some nasty default behavior
  - Guess what the `MAR1` gene gets recorded as?
+ Very hard to recover from errors
  - Shift of one error (off by one row or column)
  - Google _Duke Potti_ or _Reinhart Rogoff Herndon_

# Dynamic graphics

## Dynamic graphics in R

There are several package in R that provide dynamic graphics meant to be consumed on the web.

Many of these are wrappers around well-known Javascript libraries like D3.js, leaflet.js and others

These packages have mostly come under the umbrella of of the `htmlwidgets` package, which allows these
HTML-based graphics to be displayed through R and R Markdown

## Dynamic graphics in R

There are several broad categories of dynamic graphs

General purpose:

```{r, echo=FALSE }
tribble(
    ~Package, ~Description,
    'r2d3' , 'Interface for D3.js, requires D3.js code',
    'plotly', 'Interface with plot.ly, direct conversion from ggplot2',
    'highcharter', 'Using the Highcharts.js package',
    'dygraphs', 'For time series or longitudinal data'
) %>%
    knitr::kable() %>%
    kable_styling()

```

Maps: 

```{r }
tribble(
    ~Package, ~Description,
        "leaflet", "Maps using OpenStreetMaps") %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling()
```

---

## Dynamic graphics in R

Networks:

```{r }
tribble(~Package, ~Description,
        'networkD3', 'Dynamic network visualizations using D3',
        'visNetwork', 'Interface to the vis.js library') %>%
    kable() %>% kable_styling()
        
```

# Plotly
https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries

---

## Plotly

Plotly is a company that developed the `plotly.js` graphing library, as well as packages for R and Python. 

For the R package, it developed a turnkey method to convert `ggplot2` graphics into interactive graphs.

.pull-left[
```{r g1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
plt <- ggplot(penguins,
              aes(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g,
                  color = species))+
    geom_point()
plt
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
ggplotly(plt)
```
]

---

## Plotly

You can do some customization on the tooltips (what shows up when you put your mouse over a point). 

```{r , fig.height=5, fig.width=12, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))+
    geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
ggplotly(p, tooltip = c('cut')) #<<

```
---

## Plotly

You can do linked plots in plotly, so interactions in one plot are reflected in a second plot. This is called _brushing_. The key here is to use `highlight_key`, which allows a data frame to be shared between multiple
plots at the same time. 

```{r brush, echo=T, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
d <- highlight_key(penguins)
plt1 <- ggplot(d, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))+geom_point()
plt2 <- ggplot(d, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+geom_point()
subplot(plt1, plt2) %>% 
    layout(title = "Click and drag to select points") %>%
    highlight("plotly_selected")
```

---

## Plotly

You can also do brushing over multiple plots drawn on the same dataset

.left-column70[
```{r brush2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
 highlight_key(iris) %>%
       GGally::ggpairs(aes(colour = Species), columns = 1:4) %>%
       ggplotly(tooltip = c("x", "y", "colour")) %>%
       highlight("plotly_selected")
```
]
.right-column70[
**GGally** is a **ggplot2** extension that provides additional composite plot types like 
the pairs plot we use here.

# Dygraphs
https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs

---

## Dygraphs

The *dygraphs* package wraps the `dygraphs` Javascript library, which is build to chart time-series data.

```{r dyg1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven temperatures") %>%
    dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01","1960-01-01"))
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is built for linked charts, in the form of line charts + annotations + controls

---

## Dygraphs

We can also create multiple linked time series

.left-column30[
```{r dyg2, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dygraph(ldeaths, main = "All",
        group = "lung-deaths") #<<
dygraph(mdeaths, main = "Male",
        group = "lung-deaths") #<<
dygraph(fdeaths, main = "Female",
        group = "lung-deaths") #<<

```

You could name the group anything you like, as long as it's the same across the plots.
]
.right-column30[
```{r dyg22, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=2, ref.label='dyg2'}

```
]

---

## Dygraphs

You could also annotate dygraphs

```{r ,echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
dygraph(presidents, main = "Quarterly Presidential Approval Ratings") %>%
  dyAxis("y", valueRange = c(0, 100)) %>%
  dyEvent("1950-6-30", "Korea", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyEvent("1965-2-09", "Vietnam", labelLoc = "bottom")
```

# Highcharter
https://jkunst.com/highcharter/index.html

---
## Highcharter

+ The **highcharter** package provides a rich set of plotting functions for dynamic graphics
+ The R package is, in spirit, similar to **ggplot2**
    + It uses *mappings*, *aesthetics* and *geometries* (called *types*)
    + Customization can be added using additional functions in a pipe
    + Very rich set of chart types
	
---

## Highcharter


.pull-left[
```{r hc1, echo=T, eval=FALSE}
library(highcharter)

hchart(object=penguins,
       type="scatter",
       mapping = hcaes(x = body_mass_g,
                       y = flipper_length_mm ,
                       group = species)) %>%
    hc_legend(align='right',
              verticalAlign='top')

```

See how the elements are similar to what you'd put in a **ggplot2** pipe, except they are in a single function

Options can be added with pipes
]
.pull-right[
```{r , echo=F, eval=T, fig.height=4, ref.label='hc1'}

```
]

---

## Highcharter

Unlike **ggplot2**, the object to be plotted doesn't have to be a data frame

.pull-left[
```{r hc2, echo=T, eval=F}
hc1=hchart(diamonds$cut, type='column')
hc1
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ,ref.label='hc2', eval=T}

```
]

---

## Highcharter

We can make some more complex plots using **highcharter**

.pull-left[
```{r , eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(survival)
library(widgetframe)

data(lung)
lung <- dplyr::mutate(lung,
                      sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female"))
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
hchart(fit, ranges=TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r , eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(survival)
library(widgetframe)

data(lung)
lung <- dplyr::mutate(lung,sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female"))
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
hc <- hchart(fit, ranges=TRUE)
frameWidget(hc)
```
]
---

## Highcharter

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(highcharter)
mtcars2 <- mtcars[1:20, ]
x <- dist(mtcars2)
hchart(x)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(highcharter)
mtcars2 <- mtcars[1:20, ]
x <- dist(mtcars2)
frameWidget(hchart(x))
```
]

## rbokeh

**rbokeh** wraps the **bokeh** plotting library in Python

It uses a layering concept similar to **ggplot2**

---

.pull-left[
```{r rb1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(rbokeh)
p <- figure(width=400,height=400) %>%

## Maps

We've already seen maps with **leaflet** that allow data to be overlayed over cartographic maps

Using the packages introduced here, we also have mapping capabilities. See the respective websites for 
details

.pull-left[
**rbokeh**
```{r , echo=FALSE}
library(maps)
data(world.cities)

  ly_map("world", col = "gray") %>%
  ly_points(long, lat, data = caps, size = 5,
    hover = c(name, country.etc, population))
```

# Using D3.js in R

---

## r2d3

[D3.js](https://d3js.org) is a state-of-the-art Javascript library for data-driven graphics

It is widely used in data journalism, including the New York Times and the Guardian

However, it controls each aspect of a chart and so can require rather long JS scripts

<iframe src="https://d3js.org" width="100%" height="300"></iframe>

---

## r2d3

If you know D3.js, you can use it pretty easily embed them in R using the **r2d3** package

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(r2d3)

r2d3(data =  read_csv('../data/flare.csv'), d3_version = 4, script = 'bubbles.js')
```

---

## r2d3

```{r echo=TRUE}

r2d3(data = jsonlite::read_json('../data/miserables.json'), d3_version = 4, script = 'forcegraph.js')
```

---

## networkD3

You can also draw networks slightly more easily using the **networkD3** package.

.pull-left[
```{r nd3, echo=T, eval=F}
library(networkD3)
lemis <- jsonlite::fromJSON('../data/miserables.json')
lemis$links <- lemis$links %>%
    mutate(ID = 1:n()) %>% 
    gather(location, nm, source, target) %>%
    mutate(nm = as.integer(as.factor(nm))-1) %>%
    spread(location, nm)

forceNetwork(Links = lemis$links, Nodes = lemis$nodes,
             Source='source', Target='target',
             Value = 'value',
             NodeID = 'id', Group = 'group', opacity=0.7,
             zoom = TRUE, fontSize = 20)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r , echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, ref.label="nd3"}

```
]

---

## Crosstalk

**Crosstalk** is a package that allows multiple HTML widgets to share data and interact together. 

Not all packages in the **htmlwidgets** family are **crosstalk**-compatible.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
load('data/exdata.rda')
library(leaflet); library(crosstalk); library(d3scatter)

gpx1 <- gpx %>%
   mutate(Minutes = as.numeric(difftime(Time, min(Time), units = 'mins'))) %>%
   filter(Minutes <= 50) %>%
   left_join(run_data)

 shared_gpx1 <- SharedData$new(gpx1)
 bscols(
   leaflet(data = shared_gpx1, width="100%", height=450) %>% addTiles() %>%
     addCircleMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude, radius=1, color='blue'),
   list(
   d3scatter(shared_gpx1, ~Minutes, ~ HR, width="100%", height=450)
   )
 )
 bscols(
   filter_slider("Minutes","Time", shared_gpx1, ~Minutes, width="100%")
 )
```

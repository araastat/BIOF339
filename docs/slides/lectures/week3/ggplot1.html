# Data visualization with ggplot2


---
## What is ggplot2?

- A second (and final) iteration of the ggplot
- Implementation of Wilkerson's Grammar of Graphics in R
- Conceptually, a way to layer different elements onto a canvas to create a data visualization
- Started as Dr. Hadley Wickham's PhD thesis (with Dr. Dianne Cook)
- Won the John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award in 2006

- Mimicked in other software platforms
  - `ggplot` and `seaborn` in Python
  - Translated in `plotly`

---

## ggplot2 uses the __grammar__ of __graphics__

## Introduction to ggplot2

The `ggplot2` package is a very flexible and (to me) intuitive way of visualizing data.
It is based on the concept of layering elements on a canvas.

&gt; This idea of layering graphics on a canvas is, to me, a nice way of building graphs

You need:

+ A `data.frame` object
+ _Aesthetic mappings_ (aes) to say what data is used for what purpose in the viz
    + x- and y-direction
    + shapes, colors, lines
+ A _geometry object_ (geom) to say what to draw
    + You can "layer" geoms on each other to build plots

.pull-right[

### Add a data set


```r
ggplot(
* data = beaches # Tell ggplot the data you're using
)
```

&gt; Nothing has really happened yet, since we haven't said what we want to plot from the data set

&gt; The `#` symbol tells R that anything after it is a *comment* and should be ignored. We'll make a lot of use of comments in our code.

### Add a mapping from data to elements


```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
* mapping = aes(
*   x = temperature,
*   y = rainfall
  )
)
```

What goes in 

- the x and y axes
- the color of markers

]

```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(

```

What to draw:

- Points, lines

]

```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = temperature,
    y = rainfall
  )
) +
* geom_point(size = 4)
```

&gt; Options pertaining to how we want things drawn are usually put in the function for the geometry, e.g. `geom_point`, `geom_line`, etc. If the option is based on any element from the dataset, we have to wrap it in a `aes()` function. We'll see this later

# A side note on `aes`

---

## The `aes` function

The `aes` function and when it needs to be used creates quite a bit of confusion initially. Let's start with the documentation for this function


```r
?aes
```

&gt; #### Description
Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of geoms. Aesthetic mappings can be set in ggplot2() and in individual layers.

So, anytime we want to represent some aspect of the data on the plot in some form (color, shape, etc.), we have to use the `aes` function to *map* the data to the plot
---

## The `aes` function

The `aes` function can occur in one of two places:

.pull-left[
Within the `ggplot` function:


```r
ggplot(
  data=beaches,
  mapping=aes(
    x = temperature,
    y = rainfall
  )
) + 
  geom_point()
```

![](ggplot1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]
.pull-right[
In the actual `geom` layer:


```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches
) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = temperature,
      y = rainfall
    )
  )
```

![](ggplot1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

---

## The `aes` function

The `aes` function can occur in one of two places:

.pull-left[
Within the `ggplot` function:

+ You do this if the same mapping will be common to **all** the subsequent geometry layers
]
.pull-right[
In the actual `geom` layer:

+ You do this if the mapping will apply **only** to that layer
+ You do it if it makes more sense to put it in the `geom`. 
]

# Facets / Trellis / Small multiples

---
.pull-left[
### Split into facets


```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = temperature,
    y = rainfall
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(color = season_name),
    size = 4
  ) +
* facet_wrap( ~ season_name)
```

&gt; Create separate plots based on unique values of some variable (`season_name`) in your dataset

&gt; Typically this variable should a few distinct values
]
.pull-right[

### 

![](ggplot1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

---

.pull-left[
### Remove the legend


```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = temperature,
    y = rainfall
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(color = season_name),
    size = 4,
*   show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  facet_wrap( ~ season_name) 
```

&gt; Now we're getting more into the look of the plot and how much information should be on it

&gt; `show.legend` option is in `geom_point` here since it would be based on the colors of the points. If you had a different geometry like `geom_line`, you would put the `show.legend` option there if the legend was based on that geom.
]

### Change the background


```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = temperature,

  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(color = season_name),
    size = 4,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  facet_wrap( ~ season_name) +
* theme_bw()
```

&gt; Again, a look-and-feel choice

&gt; In-built `ggplot` themes are described [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). Other themes are availabe via packages [`ggthemes`](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) and others.

  ) +
  facet_wrap( ~ season_name) +

* labs(x = 'Temperature (C)', y = 'Rainfall (mm)')

## Let's start

.pull-left[

```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches, 
  mapping = aes(
    x = enterococci
  )
) + 
  geom_density()
```

&gt; This is looking at the distribution of enterococci concentration (x-axis) in this dataset

## Bacteria growth should depend on temperature....

.pull-left[

```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = enterococci,
*   group = season_name
  )
) + 
  geom_density()
```

&gt; Can't really parse the seasons out from the graph. 

]
.pull-right[

## Add some color

.pull-left[

```r
ggplot(
  data = beaches,
  mapping = aes(
    x = enterococci, 
    group = season_name,
*   color = season_name
  )
) + 
  geom_density()
```

&gt; This does better distinguish the seasons (and we get a legend as a by-product). 

&gt; But.... things are too crammed on the left of the plot. This is because the bacterial concentrations are low, with some high values. A transformation may be nice.

  geom_density() +

```

&gt; A bit better, but not great

  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
* facet_wrap(~ season_name)
```

&gt; A lot clearer!!

&gt; There's stuff we don't need now, like the legend
&gt; Also, can we please make the numbers human-readable

It is not easy to do patterns in R. Its been considered a bug rather than a feature,
since you can induce cognitive problems using patterns. It is suggested to use 
different palettes for distinguishing groups

tabulated &lt;- dat_brca %&gt;% count(Tumor)
tabulated

ggplot(
  data = tabulated,

Here we need to change the default computation    

The barplot usually computes the counts (`stat_count`)  

We suppress that here since we have already   
done the computation

## Scatter plots

.pull-left[

```r

&gt; If you keep `date` as a character, you dont see any lines plotted, and get the following warning:
&gt; 
&gt; `geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you
need to adjust the group aesthetic?`
&gt; 
&gt; This is cryptic!! This arises since `date` is a character, gets converted to a `factor` for plotting, and then R doesn't know how to join lines between factors.

# Color schemes

ggplot comes with a default color scheme. There are several other schemes available

- `scale_*_brewer` uses the [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org) palettes
- `scale_*_gradient` uses gradients
- `scale_*_distill` uses the ColorBrewer palettes, for continuous outcomes

&gt; Here * can be `color` or `fill`, depending on what you want to color

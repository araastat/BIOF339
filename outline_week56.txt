So I’m going to be changing the last 2 weeks in some sense. Next week, I’ve decided the topics will be

1. tidymodels: recipes and data prep
1. pipelines, workflows and reproducible projects
1. data preservation, provenance and good practice
1. report and presentation generatiion
1. `reprex`?

Week 6 will include

1. A sprinkling of bioinformtaics
1. Visual displays of analytic results
1. Survey of machine learning and necessary data prep
1. Questions and gotchas (basically a FAQ-kind of thing)
1. ???

Week 7 is no didactic lecture. They prepare and present their projects as R
Markdown documents or presentations, accompanied by a 5 minute video
presentation of the work. They MUST submit by that Saturday, I believe, since
Canvas will shut down for the end of the term. It’s a hard stop.
